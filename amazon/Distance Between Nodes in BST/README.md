Given a list of unique integers nums.

Construct a BST from it (you need to insert nodes one-by-one with the given order to get the BST)

Find the distance between two nodes node1 and node2.

Distance is the number of edges between two nodes.

If any of the given nodes does not appear in the BST, return -1.

Input
The input consists of three arguments:

nums: a list of integers representing the nodes list

node1: a integer representing the nodes

node2: a integer representing the nodes

Output
return a integer representing distance between two nodes node1 and node2

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
nums = [2, 1, 3]

node1 = 1

node2 = 3

Output: 2
