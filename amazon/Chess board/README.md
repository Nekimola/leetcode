Given a 8X8 chess board and a starting co-ordinate of a knight X,Y and number of moves (k) the knight can take, return the number of valid squares the knight can reach by making k combination moves.

Example :

input -
origin - 0,0
moves - 1
out put is 2 - The knight can go to (2,1) and (1,2) distinct squares in one move

origin - 0,0
moves -2
output -12

0 <= X,Y <=7
1 <= K <= 30
